### Algorithm:
1. **Iterate Through the Array:**
   - Use a for loop to iterate through each element of the sorted array `nums`.

2. **Compare with Target:**
   - Within each iteration, compare the current element `nums[i]` with the target element.
   - If `nums[i]` is greater than or equal to the target, return the current index `i`. This indicates the position where the `target` should be inserted to maintain sorted order.

3. **Handle Edge Cases:**
   - If the loop completes without finding a suitable position (i.e., all elements are less than the target), return the length of the array `nums`. This indicates that the `target` should be inserted at the end of the array.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - Where `n` is the length of the array `nums`.
  - The algorithm involves a single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  - Constant space is used as only a few variables (`i` and `result`) are maintained.
