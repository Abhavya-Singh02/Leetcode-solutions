### Algorithm:
1. **Find Length of the List:**
   - Implement a helper method `findLength` to calculate the length of the linked list.
   - Iterate through the list and count the number of nodes, updating a counter variable.

2. **Calculate Node to Remove:**
   - Calculate the index of the node to remove from the end of the list as `(length - n - 1)`, where `length` is the length of the list.
   - If the index is -1 (indicating removal of the head node), return `head.next`.

3. **Traverse and Remove Node:**
   - Traverse the list until reaching the node just before the node to be removed (identified by the calculated index).
   - Update the `next` pointer of the preceding node to skip the node to be removed.

4. **Return Modified List:**
   - Return the head of the modified list.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - Where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list.
  - The algorithm traverses the list twice: once to find its length and once to remove the specified node.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  - Constant space is used as only a few variables (`length`, `i`, `traverseTill`, `curr`) are maintained.
