### Algorithm:
1. **Initialize Two Pointers:**
   - Initialize two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, both initially pointing to the head of the linked list.

2. **Traverse with Pointers:**
   - Use a while loop to traverse the linked list with two pointers:
     - `slow` moves one step at a time.
     - `fast` moves two steps at a time.

3. **Detect Cycle:**
   - While traversing, if there is a cycle in the linked list, the `fast` pointer will eventually catch up to the `slow` pointer, indicating the presence of a cycle.
   - If a cycle is detected, return `true`.

4. **Return Result:**
   - If the loop completes without detecting a cycle (i.e., `fast` reaches the end of the list), return `false` to indicate that no cycle exists.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - Where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list.
  - Both pointers traverse the list once, but the `fast` pointer moves twice as fast as the `slow` pointer.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  - Constant space is used as only a few variables (`slow` and `fast`) are maintained.
