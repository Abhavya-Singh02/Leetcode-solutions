### Algorithm:
1. **Handling Negative Numbers:**
   - Check if `x` is negative. If it is, return `false` immediately as negative numbers cannot be palindromes.

2. **Reverse the Number:**
   - Initialize a variable `reverse` to store the reverse of the number.
   - Initialize another variable `original` to store the original value of `x`.
   - Using a while loop, extract the last digit of `x` using modulo division (`x % 10`) and add it to the `reverse` variable after multiplying it by 10. This effectively reverses the digits of `x`.
   - Update `x` by removing its last digit (`x / 10`).
   - Repeat this process until `x` becomes zero.

3. **Check for Palindrome:**
   - After the while loop, compare the reversed number (`reverse`) with the original number (`original`).
   - If they are equal, return `true`, indicating that the number is a palindrome.
   - Otherwise, return `false`.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity:** O(log n)
  - The time complexity is logarithmic because the number of digits in `x` determines the number of iterations required in the while loop.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  - Constant space is used as only a few variables (`reverse`, `original`, `lastdigit`) are maintained.
