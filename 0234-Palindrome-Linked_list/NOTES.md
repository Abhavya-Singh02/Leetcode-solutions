### Algorithm:
1. **Check Base Cases:**
   - If the input linked list is empty or has only one node, it is considered a palindrome. Return `true` in such cases.

2. **Find Middle and Reverse Second Half:**
   - Find the middle node of the linked list using the `getMiddle` method.
   - Reverse the second half of the linked list starting from the node next to the middle using the `reverse` method.

3. **Compare First and Second Halves:**
   - Traverse both the first half (starting from the head) and the reversed second half simultaneously.
   - Compare the values of corresponding nodes.
     - If any mismatch is found, the linked list is not a palindrome. Return `false`.
     - If all values match, continue traversing until one of the halves reaches the end.

4. **Return Result:**
   - If the traversal completes without finding any mismatches, the linked list is a palindrome. Return `true`.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - Where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list.
  - The algorithm traverses the entire list twice: once to find the middle node and once to compare values of first and second halves.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  - Constant space is used as only a few variables (`Hare`, `Turtle`, `prev`, `currNode`, `nextNode`, `firstHalfhead`, and `SecondHalfhead`) are maintained.
