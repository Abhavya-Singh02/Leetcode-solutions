### Algorithm:
1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Initialize two variables `firstMinunit` and `secondMinunit` to store the two smallest prices.
   - Set both variables to `Integer.MAX_VALUE` initially, ensuring any price in the array will be smaller than these initial values.

2. **Finding the Two Smallest Prices:**
   - Iterate through each element `i` in the `prices` array.
   - If `i` is smaller than `firstMinunit`, update both `firstMinunit` and `secondMinunit`.
   - If `i` is not smaller than `firstMinunit`, check if `i` is smaller than `secondMinunit` and update `secondMinunit` accordingly.

3. **Calculating Leftover Money:**
   - After finding the two smallest prices (`firstMinunit` and `secondMinunit`), calculate the leftover money by subtracting the sum of these two prices from the total `money`.

4. **Returning Result:**
   - If the leftover money is greater than or equal to zero, return the leftover amount.
   - If the leftover money is negative, indicating insufficient money to buy the two cheapest chocolates, return the original `money` amount.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - The algorithm iterates through each element of the `prices` array once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  - Constant space is used as only a few variables (`firstMinunit`, `secondMinunit`, `leftover`) are maintained.
